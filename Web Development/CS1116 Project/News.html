          <h3><b>Daft Punk Release Deluxe RAM Box Set in LA Pop Up Shop</b></h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>After spending years under the radar, the "Get Lucky" duo have finally surfaced. 'Thomas Bangalter' and 'Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo' have opened a pop up shop in downtown LA which features a host of goodies that Daft Punk enthusiasts can enjoy</p>
            <p>As well as featuring a retrospective of archival set pieces, props, robot helmets, artwork, photography and wardrobe, the shop will also have a selection of limited edition Daft Punk garments and accessories created by influential boundary pushing designers such as Gosha Rubchinskiy, Off-White, Enfants Riches Deprimes, Darkdrom, Hervet Manufacturier and Han Cholo. They're also releasing a special edition of their Random Access Memories Vinyl in the form of a deluxe box set</p>
            <p>The box set will feature a series of transparent slides that, when combined together, make up the anatomy of the robots. In addition to this it will feature two USBs containing the master tracks of the iconic tracklist of RAM as well as a book publisising exclusive images of some of the moments which led to the creation of this album.</p>
            <p>All in all, while the price is expensive (it will set you back approximately â‚¬250), we would recommmend this set if you're a Daft Punk fan. Let us know what you think in the comments. NOTE: You will need an account to post comments - simply register/login at the home page!</p>
