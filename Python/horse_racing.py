# CS-1117 : 2016-2017 : Assignment #15 : Processing Race Results
"""

Consider a race in which the score of each entrant is the
place in which they finish, and the score of a team is the
sum of the scores of its first three finishers. Any
finishers from a team after the third do not contribute to
that teamâ€™s score; teams with fewer than three finishers
are eliminated.
The team with the lowest overall score places first, that
with the next lowest score places second, and so forth.
Registration data for all entrants is stored in a file,
with each line consisting of the racer number, personal
name, and team name for that entrant;

Write a Python program
which will first read in this data file, and then read in
from the keyboard, one per line, the racer numbers of
entrants in the order in which they finish. Invalid race
numbers should trigger an error message, but otherwise be
skipped. The number 0 signals the end of the keyboard input.
As soon as the third member of any team finishes, the
program should output the team score, its name, and the
names of its three scoring members in their finishing
order;

The program should finally output a table containing, for
each team with three or more finishers, the team place, its
score, its name, and the names of its scoring members,
sorted in increasing order of team place, where teams on
equal scores are given the same place;
